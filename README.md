# San-Francisco-Rental-Analysis
This project looks to build a prototype dashboard for the San Francisco rental market. The goal is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco. 
First, we will work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an analysis notebook. Once the code is worked out, then we copy it over to a dashboard code and use Panel to create the final layout.

To build the dashboard, we need to accomplish the following tasks:

•	Complete a notebook of rental analysis
•	Create a dashboard of interactive visualizations to explore the market

In the first part, we need to calculate the number of housing units per year and visualize the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function. Visualize the average gross rent per year to better understand the trends for rental income over time. Determine the average sales price per year to better understand the sales price of the rental property over time. compare the average prices by neighborhood and visualize the mean sales price square foot per year with the neighborhood as a dropdown selector. 
Figure out which neighborhoods are the most expensive by calculating the mean sale price for each neighborhood and then sorting the values to obtain the top 10 most expensive neighborhoods on average and plot the results as a bar chart.
Using plotly express, create parallel coordinates and parallel categories visualizations so that investors can interactively filter and explore various factors related to the sales price of the neighborhoods. Use a scatter map box object from plotly express to visualize neighborhood location data and build an interactive map with the average prices per neighborhood.
Then, use the Panel library to build an interactive dashboard for all of the visualizations.
